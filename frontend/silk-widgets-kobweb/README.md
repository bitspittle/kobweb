Additional Silk widgets that directly depend on Kobweb.

The `silk-widgets` module does not itself depend on Kobweb. Even though very few users are expected to use Silk
without Kobweb, most widgets are designed to still work without it.

However, some widgets benefit from being integrated tightly with Kobweb functionality. This module was created to
accommodate those widgets.
