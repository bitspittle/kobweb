     * - filenames would be lowercased
     * - packages were converted into routes as is
     *
     * This is fine for most sites, where filenames and packages are usually single words. But this was problematic for
     * multi-word scenarios.
     *
     * For example, if you have a page called "StateOfArt.kt", this creates "stateofart"... where users would likely
     * prefer "state-of-art" instead, both for clarity and to avoid its flatulence-adjacent misreading.
     *
     * Hyphens are pretty common in clean URLs, so Kobweb has changed to support them as the default behavior. However,
     * this leaves users of old sites in a bit of a pickle. If they have built up links and SEO around the old link
     * formats, forcing them to change overnight could be a bit of a problem.
     *
     * Therefore, for older sites, allowing the old formats to continue to work is probably a safe idea, during which
     * time you may want to audit your links. Newer sites are encouraged to disallow these legacy redirects, since they
     * don't have to worry about potentially stale links in this case.

/**
 * A convenience method for the common case of specifying a direct dependency with the [excludeTags][AppBlock.IndexBlock.excludeTags] method.
 *
 * The value passed into this method is a prefix, so for example, the names "kotlin-bootstrap", "kotlin-bootstrap-js",
 * "kotlin-bootstrap-js-1.0", and "kotlin-bootstrap-js-1.0.klib" would all work to opt-out of accepting head elements
 * from the "kotlin-bootstrap-js-1.0.klib" artifact.
 *
 * When Kobweb detects a dependency that adds head elements, it will print a warning message that includes the value
 * of the artifact name which you can use here.
 *
 * If you call this method multiple times with different dependencies, the effect is additive.
