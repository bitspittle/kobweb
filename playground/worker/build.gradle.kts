hackWorkaroundSinceWebpackTaskIsBrokenInContinuousMode()

// For context, see: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-55820/jsBrowserDevelopmentWebpack-in-continuous-mode-doesnt-keep-outputs-up-to-date
// It seems like the webpack tasks are broken when run in continuous mode (it has a special branch of logic for handling
// `isContinuous` mode and I guess it just needs more time to bake).
// Unfortunately, `kobweb run` lives and dies on its live reloading behavior. So in order to allow it to support
// webpack, we need to get a little dirty here, using reflection to basically force the webpack task to always take the
// non-continuous logic branch.
// Basically, we're setting this value to always be false:
